# Numerical method 2 - Linear systems of equations

The purpose of the project is to implement and analyze two iterative methods (Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel) and one direct method (LU decomposition) for solving systems of linear equations. Tests of each method will be performed on systems of equations that can arise from discretization of differential equations and are commonly used in such problems as electronics, electrodynamics, mechanics (aerospace applications, biomechanics, automotive), strength testing of materials and structures, simulations of deformation, stress, displacement and vibration, acoustics, photonics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics and many others.
